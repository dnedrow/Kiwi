We're building a BDD library that is exquisitely simple to setup and use, and we'd love your help! Reporting Bugs Kiwi currently uses two channels for reporting bugs: If Kiwi isn't working as you'd expect it to, but you're not sure whether you're using it correctly, please send a message to the Kiwi Google group . Once your issue has been resolved, please consider contributing to the Wiki to help people who might experience similar issues in the future. If you're sure that you're using Kiwi correctly, but Kiwi still does not behave as you'd expect it to, you may have found a bug. If no one has already reported the issue , please submit a new issue , and include any and all information maintainers might need to fix the problem. It's not easy to fix bugs, but detailed reports help! Pull Requests Our work flow is a typical GitHub flow, where contributors fork the Kiwi repository , make their changes on branch, and submit a pull request. Please include a description of your changes with your pull request. All pull requests that involve changes to the source code should include tests that prove the changes behave as stated in the pull request message.","title":"Welcome to Kiwi!"},{"location":"About/Contributing/#welcome-to-kiwi","text":"We're building a BDD library that is exquisitely simple to setup and use, and we'd love your help!","title":"Welcome to Kiwi!"},{"location":"About/Contributing/#reporting-bugs","text":"Kiwi currently uses two channels for reporting bugs: If Kiwi isn't working as you'd expect it to, but you're not sure whether you're using it correctly, please send a message to the Kiwi Google group .
